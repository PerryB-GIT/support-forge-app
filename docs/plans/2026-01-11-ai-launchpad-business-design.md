# AI Launchpad - Business Design Document

**Date:** January 11, 2026
**Status:** Ready for JPM Pitch
**Author:** Perry / Support Forge

---

## Executive Summary

AI Launchpad transforms Support Forge from a consulting practice into a scalable AI enablement business. The core insight: businesses need AI but can't bridge the gap from "AI exists" to "my team uses it daily." AI Launchpad is that bridge.

**The Ask:** $750K - $1M to productize a proven service model.

**Year 1 Target:** $500K revenue across three tiers.

**Why Now:** AI coding tools have crossed from "developer toys" to "business essentials." The window to become THE trusted guide for AI enablement is now.

---

## The Problem

Every business knows they need AI. But there's a massive gap between "AI exists" and "my team can actually use it."

- Most people try ChatGPT, hit a wall, and give up
- The ones who figure it out gain a superpower: **30-40 hours/week back**
- Getting there currently requires expensive consultants or months of trial and error

---

## The Solution

AI Launchpad is the fastest path from "AI-curious" to "AI-powered."

We take people from zero to building and deploying real projects in 2 weeks. Not theory - hands-on setup, real tools, real results.

**What makes us different:**
- Personalized setup configured for their specific business/workflow
- Speed to value: productive in hours, not weeks
- Full stack enablement: Claude Code + GitHub + AWS + Zapier + N8N + deployment
- We teach the "why and how," not just the "what"

---

## Positioning

> "We start with Claude Code because it's the most powerful AI coding tool today. But our methodology - the setup, training, deployment playbook - applies to the entire AI enablement space. Claude Code is our wedge, not our ceiling."

**Key differentiators:**
- First-mover in Claude Code specialization
- Anthropic partnership application in progress

4. **Perfect timing:** Enterprise budgets opening for AI enablement
