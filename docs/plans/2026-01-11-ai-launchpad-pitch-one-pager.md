# AI Launchpad
### The fastest path from AI-curious to AI-powered

---

## The Problem
Every business needs AI. Few know how to actually use it. The gap between "AI exists" and "my team ships with AI daily" costs companies thousands of hours and dollars in failed experiments.

## The Solution
**AI Launchpad** takes professionals from zero to building real projects in 2 weeks. Not theory - hands-on setup, real tools, measurable results.

**Client outcome:** 30-40 hours/week reclaimed. Permanently.
