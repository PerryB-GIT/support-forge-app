## Current vs. Target Positioning

| Aspect | Current State | Target State |
|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Headline** | "We Set It Up. You Own It Forever." | "AI Strategy That Delivers ROI" |
| **Target** | Small biz owners avoiding developers | C-Suite / SMB decision makers |
| **Tone** | Scrappy, independence-focused | Premium, strategic, executive |
| **Pricing** | $2,500 - $15K (transactional) | $15K - $50K+ (strategic engagements) |
| **Service Model** | 3 tiers, self-select | Discovery call → custom proposal |
| **Pain Points** | Platform fees, developer dependency | Competitive pressure, ROI on AI spend |

## New Messaging Framework

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Average engagement value | $20K+ (up from $5K) |
| Qualified leads per month | 5-10 (vs. volume) |
| Discovery call → Assessment conversion | 40%+ |
| Assessment → Implementation conversion | 60%+ |

---

## Open Questions

1. **Pricing Display**: Show ranges on site, or "Let's talk" approach?
2. **Perry's Bio**: How much personal brand vs. company brand?
3. **Enterprise Logos**: Any clients willing to be named/featured?
4. **Retainer Model**: Launch now or add later once relationships established?

---

## Risk Considerations

- **Narrower Audience**: Fewer leads but higher quality
- **Longer Sales Cycle**: Executive buyers take longer to decide
- **Credibility Gap**: May need proof points for larger engagements
- **Pricing Pushback**: Need strong ROI narrative to justify $15K+
