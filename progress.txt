# Progress Log: Support Forge Visual Improvements

This file contains learnings and notes from each Ralph iteration.
Each Claude instance appends what it learned for future iterations.

---

## Iteration 1 - US-001

**Completed:** Added CSS animation utilities and hover effects to globals.css

**Learnings:**
- Project uses Tailwind CSS v4 with @import "tailwindcss" syntax
- CSS custom properties already defined for brand colors (--accent-glow, --forge-purple, etc.)
- No dedicated typecheck script - use `npx tsc --noEmit` in apps/web directory
- Added prefers-reduced-motion support for accessibility

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.card-hover` - lift + glow effect on hover
- `.glow-purple` - purple glow on hover
- `.scale-hover` / `.scale-hover-subtle` - scale effects
- `.animate-fade-up` / `.animate-fade-up-stagger` - scroll reveal
- `.animate-pulse-glow` - pulsing glow effect
- `.animate-float` - floating animation

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css

---

## Iteration 2 - US-002

**Completed:** Added gradient background system to globals.css

**Learnings:**
- CSS pseudo-elements (::before, ::after) work well for overlay effects
- SVG data URIs inline in CSS work for noise textures (keep opacity very low ~0.03)
- Need `pointer-events: none` on overlay pseudo-elements to allow clicks through
- Grid patterns use repeating linear-gradient with background-size for tiling
- Glow orbs use radial-gradient with blur filter for soft light effect

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.hero-gradient` - main hero linear-gradient with purple spotlight ::before
- `.hero-spotlight-right` - additional right-side radial gradient ::after
- `.section-gradient` - vertical gradient for content sections
- `.surface-gradient` - diagonal gradient for cards/elevated areas
- `.noise-texture` - subtle grain effect using SVG feTurbulence
- `.grid-pattern` - tech aesthetic grid overlay
- `.glow-orb` / `.glow-orb-small/medium/large` - decorative blur effects

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css

---

## Iteration 3 - US-003

**Completed:** Created HeroSection component with image support

**Learnings:**
- Next.js Image component with `fill` prop and `sizes` attribute handles responsive images
- Use `sizes="(max-width: 768px) 800px, (max-width: 1200px) 1200px, 1920px"` for breakpoints
- Layer overlays with z-index: image(0) < spotlights(1) < noise(2) < content(10)
- Inline CSS for radial gradients when classes aren't flexible enough
- Use animation-delay via inline style for staggered animations
- Components can use CSS classes from globals.css directly

**Props created:**
- `title` - main heading (required)
- `subtitle` - description text (optional)
- `backgroundImage` - URL for hero image (optional)
- `gradient` - enable gradient/spotlight effects (default: true)
- `children` - CTA buttons or additional content (optional)
- `size` - "sm" | "md" | "lg" for padding (default: "md")
- `align` - "left" | "center" for text alignment (default: "center")

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/ui/HeroSection.tsx

---

## Iteration 4 - US-004

**Completed:** Added hero section to Homepage with floating particles

**Learnings:**
- HeroSection title prop should be ReactNode (not string) to support JSX with styled spans
- Floating particle system uses multiple animation keyframes with varied timing for organic feel
- Particles distributed via array math: `left: ${(i * 8.5) % 100}%` for even spread
- Connection lines add network/AI feel using gradient lines with pulse animation
- Wrap HeroSection in outer section for proper positioning of absolute particles container
- Always update prefers-reduced-motion when adding new animations

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.particles-container` - absolute positioned container for particle system
- `.particle` / `.particle-sm/md/lg` - individual particle nodes with glow
- `.animate-particle-1/2/3` - varied floating animations (8s, 10s, 12s)
- `.particle-line` / `.animate-line-pulse` - connection lines between particles

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/ui/FloatingParticles.tsx

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (particle system CSS)
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (HeroSection integration)
- apps/web/src/components/ui/HeroSection.tsx (title prop type fix)

---

## Iteration 5 - US-005

**Completed:** Updated service cards with hover animations

**Learnings:**
- CSS animated gradient borders use mask-composite technique with `::before` pseudo-element
- Key properties: `padding: 1px` on pseudo-element creates border width
- `-webkit-mask` with `linear-gradient(#fff 0 0)` content-box and second gradient creates border mask
- `mask-composite: exclude` (or `-webkit-mask-composite: xor`) reveals only the border area
- `background-size: 300% 300%` with `background-position` animation creates flowing gradient effect
- Applied to 15 cards total across Challenge, Approach, Service pricing, and Results sections
- Existing card styles need `position: relative` for pseudo-element positioning (already in .service-card)

**CSS Techniques Used:**
- Gradient border via mask-composite (avoids border-image limitations)
- Animation on hover only (opacity 0 → 1 + background-position animation)
- Reduced motion support already added in US-001

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (added .service-card class with animated border)
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (applied service-card class to 15 cards)

---

## Iteration 6 - US-006

**Completed:** Added scroll-triggered fade animations

**Learnings:**
- Intersection Observer API is perfect for scroll-triggered animations
- Create generic ref-returning hook for flexibility (`useScrollReveal<T extends HTMLElement>`)
- Stagger list animations with setTimeout array and clear on unmount
- `prefersReducedMotion` check should skip animations entirely, not just adjust timing
- Wrapper components (ScrollReveal, ScrollRevealList) simplify usage over direct hook calls
- `triggerOnce: true` with `observer.unobserve()` prevents repeated animations

**Hooks Created:**
- `useScrollReveal` - single element visibility detection with Intersection Observer
- `useScrollRevealList` - extends useScrollReveal with staggered visibleItems array

**Components Created:**
- `ScrollReveal` - wrapper with fade-up/fade-in/slide-up animations
- `ScrollRevealList` - wrapper for staggered list item reveals

**CSS Technique:**
- Tailwind transitions: `transition-all duration-500 ease-out`
- Animation classes: `translate-y-5 opacity-0` → `translate-y-0 opacity-100`
- Delay via inline style: `transitionDelay: isVisible ? \`${delay}ms\` : "0ms"`

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/hooks/useScrollReveal.ts
- apps/web/src/hooks/index.ts
- apps/web/src/components/ui/ScrollReveal.tsx

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (applied ScrollReveal to all 5 homepage sections)

---

## Iteration 7 - US-007

**Completed:** Created custom icon components for Homepage pain points

**Learnings:**
- SVG icons should use `currentColor` for fill/stroke to inherit text color and enable theming
- Use `fillOpacity` (0.1-0.3) to create depth layers without hardcoding colors
- `strokeOpacity` (0.5-0.7) works well for secondary/decorative elements
- `strokeDasharray` creates dashed effects for uncertainty/motion (e.g., "4 3" or "6 2")
- Text elements in SVG use `textAnchor="middle"` for centering, need x/y positioning
- Use `<g transform="translate(x, y)">` to position groups of related elements
- Icon size prop with fixed options (24 | 48) keeps consistent usage across app

**Icon Design Patterns:**
- Racing rockets: Lead rocket larger/brighter, trailing smaller/faded, speed lines
- Chart uncertainty: Bar chart with dashed trend line, question mark in circle overlay
- Boardroom: Presentation screen with stand, data visualization, speech bubbles
- Broken gear: Dashed stroke circle, crack lines, floating pieces with directional arrows

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/icons/index.ts (barrel export)
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconCompetitivePressure.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconROIUncertainty.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconBoardQuestions.tsx

- Rocket with clock: Overlay smaller element (clock) in corner to show dual concepts
- Shield icon: Good container shape for nesting other symbols (AI chip)
- Podium icon: Use varying heights and opacity to show rank hierarchy
- Star/sparkle effects: Use small path shapes with reduced opacity for celebration feel
- Text elements in SVG: Keep font sizes small (6-8px) for legibility at 48px render size

**Icon Design Patterns:**
- Strategic clarity: Brain with radiating beams, center glow point
- Speed to value: Rocket with clock in corner, speed lines on opposite side
- Risk mitigation: Shield outline with nested AI chip (pins extend to shield edges)

- Blueprint concept: Use grid lines with low opacity, overlay faded outline of the launching element
- Partnership symbol: Combine hands with continuous ring (strokeDasharray) for "ongoing" feel
- Communication waves: Curved paths on either side suggest reach/support
- Progress indicators: Small checkmarks (✓) show completed items in lists

**Icon Design Patterns:**
- Discovery: Two profiles facing each other, connection lines with central spark/glow
- Assessment: Document with scan line, separate AI module with eye, data flow dots

---

## Iteration 10 - US-010

**Completed:** Replaced Homepage generic icons with custom icon components

**Learnings:**
- Import multiple icons from barrel export: `import { Icon1, Icon2 } from "@/components/icons"`
- Icons inherit color from parent via `currentColor` - container sets text color class
- Size prop of 24 works well in 48x48 (w-12 h-12) containers with flex centering
- Pain point icons use amber color scheme: `bg-amber-500/10` background, `text-amber-400`
- Benefit icons use accent (purple) color scheme: `bg-accent/10` background, `text-accent`
- Replacing inline SVGs with components reduces code repetition and enables consistent updates

**Icon Replacements (8 total):**
- Challenge section (pain points, amber color):
  - Competitive Pressure → IconCompetitivePressure
  - ROI Uncertainty → IconROIUncertainty
  - Board Questions → IconBoardQuestions
  - Failed Experiments → IconFailedExperiments
- Our Approach section (benefits, accent/purple color):
  - Strategic Clarity → IconStrategicClarity
  - Speed to Value → IconSpeedToValue
  - Risk Mitigation → IconRiskMitigation
  - Competitive Edge → IconCompetitiveEdge

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (added icon imports, replaced 8 inline SVGs)

---

## Iteration 11 - US-011

**Completed:** Replaced Services page generic icons with custom icons

**Learnings:**
- Services page uses consistent 48px circular containers with `bg-accent/10` background
- Same `text-accent` class pattern works for icon inheritance as Homepage
- Service sections (Discovery, Assessment, Implementation, Advisory) each have anchor IDs for navigation
- Existing page had CheckIcon and ArrowIcon local components - didn't need to touch those
- Services page follows same size 24 icon in 48px container pattern as Homepage

**Icon Replacements (4 total):**
- Discovery Call → IconDiscovery (was chat/message bubble SVG)
- AI Readiness Assessment → IconAssessment (was clipboard/checklist SVG)
- Strategic Implementation → IconImplementation (was gear/settings SVG)
- AI Advisory Retainer → IconAdvisory (was people/group SVG)

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/services/page.tsx (added icon imports, replaced 4 inline SVGs)

---

## Iteration 12 - US-012

**Completed:** Added animated process flow visualization to Services page

**Learnings:**
- Reuse existing hooks (useScrollRevealList) for scroll-triggered sequential animations
- `visibleItems.lastIndexOf(true)` finds the most recently revealed item for "active" state
- Process flow needs both desktop (horizontal) and mobile (vertical) layouts
- CSS `::before` and `::after` pseudo-elements work well for animated connection lines
- Use `background-size: 200% 100%` with animated `left` position for traveling light effect
- `mask-composite` technique not needed here - simpler gradient overlay works for line animation
- `is-visible` CSS class pattern matches process-step selector for clean transitions
- Keep animation durations reasonable (3s for line travel, 2s for pulse) - too fast feels chaotic
- Arrow bounce animation should only run when `is-active` class present

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.process-line` - horizontal connection line with traveling light `::after` pseudo-element
- `.process-step` / `.process-step.is-visible` - step node visibility transition (opacity, scale)
- `.process-step-active` - active step with pulsing border via `::after` pseudo-element
- `.step-badge-pulse` - pulsing animation for the step number badge
- `.process-arrow` / `.process-arrow.is-active` - arrow with bounce animation
- `.process-line-vertical` - vertical connection line for mobile layout

**Keyframe Animations:**
- `@keyframes line-travel` - light travels along connection line (0% → 100% left position)
- `@keyframes step-pulse` - pulsing glow around active step border
- `@keyframes badge-pulse` - subtle scale pulse on step number
- `@keyframes arrow-bounce` - horizontal bounce for directional arrows
- `@keyframes line-travel-vertical` - vertical version of line-travel for mobile

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/ui/AnimatedProcessFlow.tsx

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (process flow animation CSS)
- apps/web/src/app/services/page.tsx (AnimatedProcessFlow integration)

---

## Iteration 13 - US-013

**Completed:** Added count-up animation for statistics

**Learnings:**
- `requestAnimationFrame` provides smooth animation loop for count-up effect
- `performance.now()` gives precise timestamps for elapsed time calculation
- Easing function `easeOutQuart (1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 4))` creates satisfying deceleration curve
- Intersection Observer with `triggerOnce` pattern works well for scroll-triggered animations
- Use `hasAnimated` state flag to prevent re-triggering animation on subsequent views
- Pulse animation via CSS `@keyframes` with `scale` and `text-shadow` adds satisfying completion feedback
- Component props: `prefix`/`suffix` for formatting ($, %, K), `decimals` for decimal places
- `prefersReducedMotion` check should show final value immediately, skip animation entirely

**CSS Animation Added:**
- `@keyframes count-pulse` - scale 1 → 1.05 → 1 with text-shadow glow

**Statistics Animated (3 total):**
- 40% → `<CountUp value={40} suffix="%" />` (Reduction in Admin Time)
- 3 weeks → `<CountUp value={3} suffix=" weeks" />` (From Assessment to Live)
- $180K → `<CountUp value={180} prefix="$" suffix="K" />` (Saved in Year One)

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/ui/CountUp.tsx

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (count-pulse animation)
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (CountUp integration on 3 statistics)

---

## Iteration 14 - US-014

**Completed:** Created custom icons for About page audience sections

**Learnings:**
- Building/skyline icons: Vary building heights for visual hierarchy, windows add detail/life
- Growth arrows: Dashed `strokeDasharray="4 2"` suggests trajectory/progression
- Person silhouettes: Simple head (circle) + body (curved path) is recognizable at small sizes
- Arm pointing: Single line from shoulder creates directional emphasis
- Rocket components: Body, nose cone, window, fins, flame each as separate paths for detail
- Speed lines: Decreasing opacity (0.5, 0.4, 0.3) creates motion blur effect
- Efficiency flows: Arrows with process nodes suggest workflow/automation
- Gear teeth: Use path with M commands for each tooth position around circle
- Professional symbols: Gavel head uses rotation transform, sound block is simple rectangle
- AI chip integration: Center square with pins extending on all 4 sides, "AI" text centered

**Icon Design Patterns:**
- Mid-Market Leaders: Skyline of 4 buildings with varying heights/windows, dashed growth arrow, dollar sign on tallest
- Operational Executives: Person with arm pointing at 3 horizontal process flows, gear/cog element, checkmarks
- Growth-Focused CEOs: Person pointing at launching rocket (body/nose/window/fins/flame), speed lines, mini growth chart
- Professional Services: Gavel (head/handle/sound block), AI chip with pins on all sides, connection lines, scales of justice hint

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconMidMarketLeaders.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconOperationalExecutives.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconGrowthCEOs.tsx
- apps/web/src/components/icons/IconProfessionalServices.tsx

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/components/icons/index.ts (added audience icon exports)

---

## Iteration 15 - US-015

**Completed:** Replaced About page generic icons with custom audience icons

**Learnings:**
- Add `icon` property to data arrays to associate component references with data items
- Use `const IconComponent = client.icon` pattern in map for clean rendering
- Container size increase (w-10 h-10 → w-12 h-12) may be needed for more detailed icons
- Icons inherit color from `text-accent` class on the component via currentColor
- About page follows same import pattern as Homepage/Services: barrel import from @/components/icons

**Implementation Pattern:**
```tsx
const idealClients = [
  { title: "...", description: "...", icon: IconMidMarketLeaders },
  // ...
];

{idealClients.map((client, index) => {
  const IconComponent = client.icon;
  return <IconComponent size={24} className="text-accent" />;
})}
```

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/about/page.tsx (added icon imports, icon property to array, updated rendering)

---

## Iteration 16 - US-016

**Completed:** Created industry illustration placeholders for case studies

**Learnings:**
- `aspectRatio: "4/3"` in inline style maintains responsive aspect ratio without fixed dimensions
- Union type for industry prop provides autocomplete and type safety: `"manufacturing" | "professional-services" | ...`
- Config object pattern maps each industry to gradient, label, accentColor, and custom SVG icon
- Layered visual effects: gradient base → grid pattern → glow orb → icon → label overlay → noise texture
- Grid pattern via linear-gradient with `backgroundSize: "20px 20px"` creates tech aesthetic
- Radial gradient with negative positioning (`-top-1/2 -right-1/2`) creates soft corner glow
- Each industry has semantically meaningful icon: factory, briefcase, heart+cross, chart, chip, shopping bag

**Industry Themes:**
- Manufacturing: slate gradient, orange accent, factory with gear
- Professional Services: indigo gradient, briefcase icon
- Healthcare: teal gradient, heart with medical cross
- Financial Services: emerald gradient, ascending bar chart with trend line
- Technology: violet/purple gradient, circuit chip with pins
- Retail: rose gradient, shopping bag with price tag

**Files created:**
- apps/web/src/components/ui/IndustryIllustration.tsx

---

## Iteration 17 - US-017

**Completed:** Added industry illustrations to Results/Case Studies page

**Learnings:**
- Type mapping pattern: Create `Record<string, IndustryKey>` to convert display strings to union type
- Handle multiple display variations in mapping (e.g., "Retail" and "Retail & Distribution" → "retail")
- Fallback in component usage: `industryToKey[study.industry] || "technology"` provides safe default
- Hover effects on illustrations: Use `group` parent with `group-hover:scale-105` for zoom, plus overlay div with `group-hover:bg-accent/10` for glow
- `overflow-hidden` on parent container clips scaled image cleanly during hover
- Transition timing: `duration-500 ease-out` for zoom feels smooth, `duration-300` for color overlay
- IndustryIllustration component already has built-in fallback via industry label text overlay
- CSS/SVG illustrations are inherently lazy loaded (render on viewport entry, no network requests)
- `pointer-events-none` on glow overlay ensures hover doesn't interfere with any future click handlers

**Implementation Pattern:**
```tsx
const industryToKey: Record<string, IndustryKey> = {
  "Manufacturing": "manufacturing",
  "Professional Services": "professional-services",
  // ...
};

<div className="relative overflow-hidden group">
  <div className="transition-transform duration-500 ease-out group-hover:scale-105">
    <IndustryIllustration
      industry={industryToKey[study.industry] || "technology"}
      className="w-full"
    />
  </div>
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-accent/0 group-hover:bg-accent/10 transition-colors duration-300 pointer-events-none" />
</div>
```

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/results/page.tsx (added imports, industry mapping, illustration rendering with hover effects)

---

## Iteration 18 - US-018

**Completed:** Enhanced testimonial section styling on homepage

**Learnings:**
- CSS pseudo-elements (::before) work well for decorative quote icons - position absolute, large font-size (120px), low opacity (0.1), serif font for classic look
- Gradient backgrounds on cards: Use multi-stop gradients with purple tints at edges (0.05 to 0.08 opacity) and dark center for depth
- Avatar gradients: Use multiple layers - base gradient (::before for highlight glow at 30% 30%), (::after for bottom shadow)
- Hover state transitions: Include border-color in transition for subtle glow effect (rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.3))
- Quote icon scale animation: `transform: scale(1.1)` on hover with increased opacity creates subtle "breathing" effect
- Remove `bg-surface` when using custom gradient background in CSS class to avoid conflicts
- Letter avatars still visible on gradient background when using `text-white` instead of `text-accent`
- Always add new CSS classes to prefers-reduced-motion media query for accessibility

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.testimonial-card` - gradient background, decorative quote ::before, hover lift + glow + border-color transition
- `.avatar-gradient` - multi-stop purple gradient with highlight (::before) and depth shadow (::after)

**Implementation Pattern:**
```css
.testimonial-card::before {
  content: '"';
  position: absolute;
  top: -10px;
  right: 20px;
  font-size: 120px;
  font-family: Georgia, serif;
  color: var(--forge-purple);
  opacity: 0.1;
  transition: opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease;
}

.testimonial-card:hover::before {
  opacity: 0.2;
  transform: scale(1.1);
}
```

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (added .testimonial-card and .avatar-gradient classes, updated prefers-reduced-motion)
- apps/web/src/app/page.tsx (replaced service-card with testimonial-card on 3 testimonial cards, updated avatar styling)

---

## Iteration 19 - US-019

**Completed:** Enhanced footer with visual improvements

**Learnings:**
- Footer gradient: Use vertical gradient (180deg) with dark purple tints, darker in middle for depth
- Grid pattern overlay: `background-image` with two linear-gradients at 0deg and 90deg creates subtle grid lines
- Top edge glow: ::after pseudo-element with horizontal gradient (transparent → purple → transparent) at 50% width creates focused highlight
- Logo glow: Radial gradient with blur(8px) filter behind logo, expand on hover with scale(1.1)
- Animated underline: Use ::after pseudo-element with width: 0 → 100% transition on hover
- Gradient underline: `linear-gradient(90deg, solid color → faded)` creates directional flow effect
- Vertical separators: Gradient with transparent ends (0%, 100%) and solid middle (20%, 80%) looks natural
- Hide elements responsively: `@media (max-width: 767px)` with `display: none` for mobile
- Heading accent underlines: Fixed 24px width with 2px height creates subtle brand touch
- z-index on content wrapper ensures content appears above ::before and ::after overlays
- Add padding-left (md:pl-6) alongside separator to create visual breathing room

**CSS Classes Added:**
- `.footer-enhanced` - gradient background with grid pattern (::before) and top edge glow (::after)
- `.footer-logo-glow` - radial gradient blur behind logo with hover intensification
- `.footer-link` - animated underline via ::after width transition
- `.footer-separator` - vertical gradient line (hidden on mobile)
- `.footer-heading` - 24px purple accent underline

**Implementation Pattern:**
```css
/* Animated underline link */
.footer-link::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -2px;
  left: 0;
  width: 0;
  height: 1px;
  background: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--forge-purple) 0%, rgba(139, 92, 246, 0.5) 100%);
  transition: width 0.3s ease;
}

.footer-link:hover::after {
  width: 100%;
}
```

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/globals.css (added footer enhancement CSS classes, updated prefers-reduced-motion)
- apps/web/src/components/layout/Footer.tsx (applied all footer classes: wrapper, logo glow, links, separators, headings)

---


## Iteration 20 - US-020

**Completed:** Added hero sections to Services, About, and Results pages

**Learnings:**
- Reusing HeroSection component: Import and configure with props (title, subtitle, gradient, size, children)
- JSX titles for mixed formatting: Pass JSX directly to title prop for accent spans, e.g., `title={<>Text <span className="text-accent">Highlighted</span></>}`
- Children prop for badges: Place badge/pill elements in children to render above title
- Additional content in children: Extra paragraphs can go in children below subtitle
- Size variants: "lg" for primary pages (Services), "md" for secondary pages (About, Results)
- gradient prop: Boolean prop enables gradient background styling from HeroSection CSS
- Consistency over customization: Using same component across pages creates unified brand feel

**HeroSection Usage Patterns:**
```tsx
// Services page - lg with JSX title and extra content
<HeroSection
  title={<>AI Strategy That <span className="text-accent">Delivers Results</span></>}
  subtitle="We don't sell packages. We solve problems."
  gradient
  size="lg"
>
  <div className="badge">Strategic AI Consulting</div>
  <p className="extra-content">Additional roadmap description...</p>
</HeroSection>

// About/Results pages - md with simple title
<HeroSection
  title="Page Title"
  subtitle="Descriptive subtitle text..."
  gradient
  size="md"
>
  <div className="badge">Badge Text</div>
</HeroSection>
```

**Files changed:**
- apps/web/src/app/services/page.tsx (added HeroSection import, replaced custom hero with component)
- apps/web/src/app/about/page.tsx (added HeroSection import, replaced custom hero with component)
- apps/web/src/app/results/page.tsx (added HeroSection import, replaced custom hero with component)
